**Subject**: NEXUS Health Mesh - Healthcare AI Research Proposal for Pitt-Anthropic Partnership

---

Dear University of Pittsburgh Leadership,

I'm writing to propose a healthcare AI research initiative that directly aligns with Pitt's groundbreaking Anthropic-AWS partnership and the university's vision for an AI-enabled Campus of the Future.

## **What We're Proposing**

The **NEXUS Health Mesh** - a federated AI coordination infrastructure for multi-stakeholder healthcare that leverages Claude's capabilities for clinical decision support, care coordination, and patient engagement.

**Perfect Fit**: This builds directly on Pitt's Health Sciences and Sports Analytics Cloud Innovation Center, using Claude Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5 through Amazon Bedrock.

---

## **Why This Aligns with Pitt's Vision**

### **1. Extends Pitt's AI-Enabled Campus Initiative**

Pitt is already pioneering "how institutions can responsibly integrate AI in higher education" (Johanna Bowman, Anthropic). NEXUS extends this to **healthcare delivery**:

- **Education**: Claude for Education (current focus)
- **Healthcare**: NEXUS for clinical coordination (proposed)
- **Research**: Federated learning network (future)

### **2. Leverages Existing Infrastructure**

You already have:
- ✅ Claude Opus 4.1 + Sonnet 4.5 via Amazon Bedrock
- ✅ PittGPT custom AI applications
- ✅ Health Sciences Cloud Innovation Center
- ✅ UPMC clinical integration (AI already in pathology per Dr. Pantanowitz)
- ✅ AWS secure cloud infrastructure

**We need exactly what you have.**

### **3. Matches "Forging the Future" Summit Themes**

From your October 2025 summit:
- ✅ AI transforming healthcare delivery
- ✅ Pittsburgh as hub of AI + health innovation
- ✅ "Synergistic research, education, and clinical activity"
- ✅ Collaboration between universities, industry, communities

**NEXUS embodies these themes.**

---

## **The Healthcare Coordination Challenge**

**Current State** (per your summit discussions):
- AI is improving patient engagement, drug discovery, clinical decision support
- UPMC already uses AI in pathology (Dr. Pantanowitz's cervical cancer detection)
- BUT: Care coordination between hospitals, families, and payers remains fragmented

**NEXUS Solution**:
- **Federated AI Mesh** coordinates multiple stakeholders
- **Preserves data sovereignty** (PHI stays at UPMC)
- **Uses Claude** for natural language coordination
- **Built on AWS Bedrock** (your existing infrastructure)

**Think**: "ChatGPT Groups for Healthcare" - but HIPAA-compliant, using Pitt's Claude infrastructure.

---

## **Technical Alignment**

### **Your Infrastructure + Our Architecture**

```
Pitt's Current Setup:
├─ Claude Opus 4.1 / Sonnet 4.5 (via AWS Bedrock) ✅
├─ PittGPT (custom AI applications) ✅
├─ Health Sciences Cloud Innovation Center ✅
├─ UPMC clinical systems (EHR integration) ✅
└─ AI Scholar-Teacher Alliance (responsible AI frameworks) ✅

NEXUS Architecture:
├─ Multi-stakeholder coordination (Patient, Family, Providers, Payers)
├─ Federated learning (hospitals learn without sharing data)
├─ Observer AI (internal quality/safety sentinel)
├─ Cryptographic provenance (HIPAA-compliant audit trail)
└─ Built on Claude + AWS Bedrock ← PERFECT MATCH

Integration:
└─ NEXUS runs ON your existing Pitt-Anthropic-AWS infrastructure
```

---

## **Research Opportunities**

### **1. Clinical Effectiveness Study**

**Question**: Does Claude-powered care coordination improve patient outcomes?

**Study Design**:
- Pilot: 100-500 UPMC patients (chronic disease cohort)
- Intervention: NEXUS mesh coordination
- Control: Standard care
- Duration: 6 months
- Measures: Readmissions, patient satisfaction, cost

**Funding**: NIH R01 ($2-3M) or AHRQ grant

---

### **2. Federated Learning at Scale**

**Question**: Can hospitals learn from each other while preserving privacy?

**Pitt's Strengths**:
- Pittsburgh Center for AI Innovation in Medical Imaging (CAIIMI)
- 124 members across Pitt + UPMC + CMU
- Existing AI radiology research (Dr. Shandong Wu)

**NEXUS Contribution**: Federated learning infrastructure for clinical data (beyond imaging)

---

### **3. Responsible AI in Healthcare**

**Question**: How do we ensure AI governance at scale?

**Pitt's Leadership**:
- AI Scholar-Teacher Alliance (responsible AI frameworks)
- "Helpful, honest, harmless" alignment (Anthropic commitment)
- First university with institution-wide AI deployment

**NEXUS Contribution**: Observer AI sentinel (internal quality/safety watchdog)

---
