Nexus Mesh

AI-Coordinated Healthcare Trust Mesh & Life-Continuity System A decentralized, compliance-aligned coordination fabric for patient-centered care, organizational sovereignty, and AI-assisted medical workflows.

Overview

Nexus Mesh is a next-generation healthcare coordination framework designed to:

Maintain patient autonomy and control over consent

Preserve health system sovereignty (no forced data centralization)

Enable AI-augmented clinical decision flow

Improve care continuity across facilities & life transitions

Provide a tamper-evident audit trail and compliance guardrails

Support federated learning without sharing raw PHI

Enable Observer AI to detect and flag safety/quality drift

Unlike traditional platforms, Nexus Mesh does not replace EHRs or force data integration. It creates a mesh trust layer to coordinate care, information, and policy enforcement across institutions — without breaking privacy, compliance, or ownership boundaries.

Core Capabilities

✅ Patient-controlled consent ledger ✅ Federated SMART-on-FHIR APIs ✅ Event-driven care coordination bus ✅ Cryptographic signed clinical summaries ✅ Ledger-anchored compliance records ✅ Internal safety “Observer AI” (non-surveillance) ✅ Cross-border compliance model (HIPAA/GDPR-aware) ✅ “Life Continuity AI” companion for high-stress events ✅ Support for AI-human decision arbitration

Architecture - High Level Layer Function Patient AI Identity continuity, consent, personal health context Clinical AI Evidence synthesis, safety checks, care planning Mesh Ledger Signed hashes, audit trail, integrity guarantees FHIR + Event Bus Standards-based exchange + async workflows Observer AI Internal compliance & safety sentinel Wallet Portable encrypted medical summaries for travel/emergency Key Principles

Patient sovereignty first

Minimum-necessary access

Hospitals control data, AI assists — never overrides

Defense-in-depth security & observability

Human-in-the-loop escalation paths

Fail safe, degrade gracefully

Primary Use Cases

Hospital-to-hospital patient transfer

Surgery decisions w/ documented consent trail

ICU discharge and step-down workflows

Cross-provider care coordination

Emergency travel health data access

Patient advocacy support

Elder care & support network coordination

Post-surgery / chronic care continuity

Roadmap Phase Description

Proof of Concept | Repo scaffolding, ledger model, basic APIs

Clinical Pilot | Single-hospital deployment + patient wallet

Multi-Hospital Mesh | Cross-institution verification + Observer AI

Global Federation | Multi-jurisdiction data mesh nodes
