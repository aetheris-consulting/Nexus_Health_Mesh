**Subject**: Healthcare AI Research - NEXUS for Pitt-Anthropic Partnership

**Body**:
"Hi Johanna,

I saw your work with University of Pittsburgh on Claude for Education - congratulations on this pioneering partnership!

I've developed a healthcare AI coordination platform (NEXUS) that would be a perfect extension of Pitt's "AI-enabled Campus of the Future" - specifically for clinical care coordination using Claude Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5 via AWS Bedrock.

Would you be open to an introduction to the right person at Pitt? I believe this could showcase Claude's healthcare applications and strengthen the Pitt-Anthropic partnership.

[Brief description + GitHub link]

Best,
Thomas"

**Why**: Warm intro from Anthropic > cold email

---

## **🎯 Best Approach (Recommended)**

### **Step 1: Email Johanna Bowman at Anthropic** (Today)
Get warm introduction to Pitt leadership

### **Step 2: If No Response After 1 Week**
Direct email to Mark Henderson (CIO) with Anthropic CC'd

### **Step 3: If Still No Response After 2 Weeks**
Multi-stakeholder email (Provost + Health Sciences faculty)

---

## **📝 Key Talking Points**

### **Perfect Timing**
- Pitt-Anthropic partnership announced Oct 2025
- "Forging the Future" summit just happened
- Q1 2026 = Perfect pilot timing

### **Perfect Infrastructure Match**
- You have Claude Opus 4.1 + Sonnet 4.5
- You have AWS Bedrock
- You have UPMC clinical integration
- **NEXUS runs on exactly this stack**

### **Perfect Strategic Fit**
- Extends education AI to healthcare delivery
- Demonstrates Claude in clinical settings
- Positions Pitt as national model
- Strengthens Anthropic relationship

### **Low Ask, High Value**
- Use existing infrastructure (no new procurement)
- Small pilot (100-500 patients)
- Joint publications (prestige for Pitt)
- Grant funding (NIH, AHRQ)

## **🚨 Things to Avoid**

❌ **Don't**: Mass email to 10+ people at once  
✅ **Do**: Targeted emails with strategic CC's

❌ **Don't**: Over-promise ("this will revolutionize healthcare")  
✅ **Do**: Be humble ("seeking research collaboration")

❌ **Don't**: Send before GitHub is ready  
✅ **Do**: Have professional repo live first

❌ **Don't**: Generic academic pitch  
✅ **Do**: Specific to Pitt-Anthropic partnership

---

## **📅 Timeline**

**Week 1** (This week):
- Set up GitHub (public repository)
- Email Johanna Bowman (Anthropic warm intro)
- If she responds quickly, get introduced to Pitt

**Week 2**:
- If no Anthropic response, direct email to Mark Henderson
- CC Johanna Bowman anyway (shows relationship)

**Week 3-4**:
- Follow up if needed
- Multi-stakeholder approach if still no response
- Consider reaching out to individual faculty directly

**Month 2+**:
- Assuming interest, start pilot discussions
- IRB submission
- Grant proposals

---

## **💡 Success Indicators**

**Good Response** (80% probability if email well-crafted):
- Reply from Henderson or delegate within 1-2 weeks
- Interest in learning more
- Meeting scheduled

**Great Response** (30% probability):
- Enthusiastic reply
- Anthropic engaged
- Multiple stakeholders interested
- Fast-tracked pilot discussions

**No Response** (20% probability):
- No reply after 3 weeks
- Try individual faculty directly (Dr. Pantanowitz, Dr. Wang, Dr. Tafti)
- Consider Stanford HAI as backup

---

## **🎁 Pitt-Specific Advantages**

Why Pitt is BETTER than Stanford HAI for you:

1. **Infrastructure Already Deployed**
   - Pitt has Claude + AWS Bedrock NOW
   - Stanford would need to set up everything

2. **Active Anthropic Partnership**
   - Pitt has working relationship with Anthropic
   - You leverage existing trust

3. **UPMC Clinical Access**
   - Pitt has direct hospital integration
   - Stanford Health is separate entity

4. **Pittsburgh Location**
   - You're closer (easier to travel)
   - Veteran-friendly city
   - Lower cost of living for pilot

5. **Less Competition**
   - Stanford gets 100+ proposals/week
   - Pitt is hungry for healthcare AI wins

**Verdict**: **Start with Pitt. If no response, pivot to Stanford HAI.**
